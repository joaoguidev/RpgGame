                    <h1>How Impactful was Shin Megami Tensei?</h1>
                    <p>
                        Shin Megami Tensei greatly contributed to the RPG genre,
                        during the time of its release it was the only RPG to be
                        set in present tense instead of in a futuristic/past
                        tense world or a fantasy world, this set the game up
                        completely different from any RPG of the time while
                        set-in current time Tokyo the point was to make it
                        relatable for the player, and show the struggles any
                        average person has to deal with while showing anybody
                        can be important or make a change. Unlike other RPGs of
                        its time or nowadays you won't find the main enemy/
                        villain being some big bad crazy monster but a fight
                        between two different ideologies shown through the games
                        storyline as a battle between God and Satan.

                        SMT is over 30 years old and is based off of a novel of
                        the same name but still has new games coming out today
                        it inspired the devil Summoner series and the Persona
                        series made by the same creators and has become a very
                        popular series all over the world still growing in size
                        today. Most RPG's have a good and intriguing storyline
                        but SMT went a whole level above that, it's storyline
                        had multiple different endings causing character
                        development that was so deep party members could die
                        twice, party members that didnâ€™t agree with the main
                        character would even become your enemy and force you to
                        kill them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        SMT doesn't stand up to graphics nowadays but back in
                        the 1990s when the game released it was impressive for
                        how many different sprites still had animations and
                        although the different Dungeons the player went through
                        were basic in design the back tracking was not very
                        tough in this game as it was in many RPGs of its time.
                        SMT was very different from any RPG game and has brought
                        forth a massive amount of games underneath it's belt
                        following the same idea that the antagonist isn't always
                        a person or monster sometimes it's the difference in
                        ideas or how people choose to live their lives or judge
                        people on their lives.
