                        Most people love being the hero of the story. This is
                        done in a game by either making the story or gameplay
                        relatable. In Shin Megami Tensei they are an excellent
                        example of this. The game starts by having the player
                        wake up by an email in Tokyo. Something that can happen
                        to anybody but then that's where the twist of the story
                        starts. This email is a Demon summoning program that
                        breaks all Hell loose. The government declares martial
                        law and the player can now live out their wildest
                        fantasy of slaying demons to save his home city. For a
                        game originally only released in Japan, this really
                        appealed to the main audience. Protect their home while
                        slaying demons. The player can fantasize about being the
                        hero they always wanted to be in a fantasy land that
                        reminds them of being at home. Most people just want to
                        do everything they can in their power to help and this
                        game gives it to them. This game can fulfill a person's
                        need to be a hero in an unrealistic scenario that would
                        be impossible to adventure in until this game.
