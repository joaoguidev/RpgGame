                        The whole series has its origins based on the novel
                        Digital Devil Story of the author Aya Nishitani and this
                        fact stand out to me. Book authors, especially
                        novelists, are very competent and have the right skills
                        to create a lure that surrounds the narrative, and the
                        story been told. The Witcher is another example of a hit
                        game that had was also based on a novel. Having this
                        support grants to a franchise a solid base for future
                        interactions of the game, even on sequels of it end up
                        not been based on the book anymore. The “flavor”
                        provided by it is already there.

                        I would divide what brings the player to the mindset to
                        enjoy the game and get immersed in it in two folds. One
                        is the real-world aspects of the story and the other the
                        fantasy aspects of it. The real world provides
                        parameters to the player so the reality portrayed in the
                        game is relatable. With that relatability established it
                        is possible to further the game story by adding fantasy
                        aspects (demons) but at that point, the player’s
                        attention and imagination have already been captured
                        therefore enabling the suspension of disbelief.

                        Shin Megami Tensei was released in 1992, a very distinct
                        period of history. The Berlin Wall had just fallen 3
                        years earlier and with it, the constant threat of
                        nuclear annihilation had just ended. The cold war
                        feeling was just dissipating but it was still present in
                        the general public imagination and culture. Shin Megami
                        Tensei’s story presents seems divided into the two
                        layers mentioned in the last paragraph (real-word and
                        fantasy). The beginning of the story brings back the
                        cold war-like feeling of nuclear conflict. It uses that
                        as a gate to bring the player’s mindset to the story.
                        Next, the fantasy aspect becomes much more prevalent,
                        the protagonist is transported 30 years in the future
                        and finds a dystopian ruined planet filled with demons,
                        but at this point, the player is already paying
                        attention and willing to enter into this world with the
                        suspension of disbelief and increasingly engaged and
                        willing to venture into this world.
