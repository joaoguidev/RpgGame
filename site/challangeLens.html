                        The overall situation for Shin Megami Tensei can be
                        confusing at first the game seems simple, the main
                        character has a dream one night about demons and people
                        he will meet later in the game and as his whole world
                        starts to flip upside down as you go from average boy to
                        killing zombie cops that are helping a bad guy sacrifice
                        a girl, but then the game kills everyone with a nuke and
                        it seems like that should be the end. However, the
                        player wakes up 30 years into the future somehow alive
                        and the world has become a war between literal God and
                        Satan, the player must choose to pick a side or either
                        side, this will change some storyline and the ending of
                        the game.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In the end the situation for the main character is one
                        of hardship and constant struggle against two ideologies
                        expressed by the war between God and Satan, although the
                        storyline is confusing it is a very long game so going
                        through it the player goes at a slow pace with lots more
                        detail and time to explain the deeper workings for the
                        storyline making it not as confusing. This game is very
                        story heavy and not like many other games of its time or
                        nowadays truly making it a very unique game that many
                        players fell in love with as there had not been a game
                        like this before in America. Most RPGs tend to live in a
                        fantasy world or another time period But SMT was set in
                        current time making characters and their problems
                        relatable to the player.
