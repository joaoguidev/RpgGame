                        Shin Megami Tensei leans on its story to make any sense
                        this is because without it the game would just seem as
                        this giant thrown together, random mess but with the
                        story the player can understand the reasons behind the
                        actions of the main character and any side characters,
                        during the beginning of the game the main character
                        finds himself in jail without the storyline to explain
                        why you were thrown in there it would just be a random
                        stage or area to fight enemies but with the storyline
                        the player can understand the police put him there for
                        misunderstanding and so the player can meet new party
                        members and build the party, this also helped explain
                        why you get the function to summon demons as you meet a
                        man it is trapped in a cell who gives the function to
                        you.

                    <p>
                        The story in SMT is very deep and builds a complex
                        adventure for the main character as this story is needed
                        to make the game not boring, it is supported by the
                        actions of the character and the NPCs in the game as the
                        story will change depending on actions the player
                        chooses. Although in the game it is never directly
                        stated the main character cares about the fate of the
                        world it is pretty obvious that if the world was being
                        overrun by demons and everyone you cared about was
                        either turning into demons or being killed by them that
                        you would fight to save your own life and people you
                        care about, during the beginning of the game although we
                        don't meet the main character's father the mother
                        shortly after the start is killed by a demon that eats
                        her and takes her form to pretend to be her main
                        character killed her and continues on the story.

                        For most of the story it seems like the other party
                        members have specific drives one party member craves
                        power and naturally he turns to the chaotic side the
                        other party member dies and is reincarnated as “Jesus”
                        without the game directly calling him that the only
                        party member that will stick with you no matter what
                        choices you make in the game is the female lead while
                        the other two you can either join one of them or go
                        against both of them and end up killing them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The main obstacles in SMT are the fluctuation and how
                        many party members you can rely on as said the two male
                        party members that accompany you at the beginning of the
                        game will leave at different times and may join you
                        again depending on your choices however you also will
                        lose party members based on your alignment of lawful or
                        chaotic or because of storyline will disappear from your
                        party for a period of time, at one point in the game you
                        lose all your party members and any demons you could
                        normally summon this part of the game fits in with the
                        storyline and is very hard to complete on your own
                        although there isn't one specific antagonist behind the
                        game as with the SMT series the main point of the game
                        is a fight behind two opposing ideologies, one is the
                        strong will survive and should rule while the other is
                        that those who don't follow the law should be
                        permanently removed neither ideology is 100% bad or good
                        hence the reason for the neutral option in the
                        storyline.
